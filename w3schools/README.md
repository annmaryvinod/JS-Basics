   1. Fixed values
   2. Variable values

* Fixed values are called Literals.

* Variable values are called Variables.

 * Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
 * Variables defined with let have Block Scope.



4. Block Scope

 * Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block


5. Var :

* Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.
* Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block.
* Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.
* Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block.
