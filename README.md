# JS-Basics
Learning basics of JS!



1. JS is not the same as Java.
2. To link a JS file to an an HTML file:
   a)Go to the html file.
   b)Within the <body> tag type
           <script src="filename.js"> </script>
3. JS is case sensitive.
4. Every JS statement ends in semicolon;
5. Comment in JS
     a) Inline comment : //
     b) Multiline comment : /* comment here!*/
6. JS follows the sequence as instructed by the code!
7. Data Type 1: Variable

     1. Variable is initialised with a 'var' keyword.
     2. The name of the var can have any number or alphabet but not start with a number.
     3. Variable values can be changed or updated.
     4. String: kept inside a quotation.


8. Math Operators In JS
       = ; assingnment  +,/,- has their usual meanings 
                        <!--  == stands for equal-->
 
 

9. === :
      == deals with the value and the last one can be used to evaluate whether we are dealing with a string or a number.


10. Please note the use of "if" , "else", "else if"

           1. "if" provides a clause before condition
           2. "else" provides code for operation in case the if condition is not satisfied.
           3. "else if" can be used to give multiple conditionings after "if".

11. Comparison tools
        == , < , > , ===            
        negation: !

    != stands for not equal to( also !==)


    (>= stands for "greater than or equal to"{similar for the other})

12. Logical Operators:
         1. AND------    && ----- valid when both conditions work!    
         2. OR-------    || ------ valid when atleast one holds true!


13. Check the code for use of WHILE LOOP.
        The syntax looks similar to that of IF


14. FOR loop can put together the "var name" , "condition" , "increment" together!
